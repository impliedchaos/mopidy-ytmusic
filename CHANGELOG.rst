- Added support for the get_images() library provider.
- Work-around for race condition when Google updates the javascript player.
- Improved support for listening to uploaded music.


v0.2.0
========================================

- Updated to only use Youtube-DL to decode the url's signature to improve speed (Youtube-DL has a lot of overhead). This also means direct access to premium stuff without having to setup authentication for YDL as well.
- Added stream quality preferences.
- Added scrobbling to YouTube Music so that play history would be updated.
- Used mopidy-gmusic code to handle timer events, and proper scrobbling.
- Split code into individual source files per class. library.py is still huge.
- Added auto playlists / mood & genre playlists / subscriptions to Library Browser.
- Added options for more stuff.
- Added support for unauthenticated access to YouTube Music.
- changed "ytm" uri scheme name to "ytmusic" for better legibility.
- also changed uris from HTTP GET style to just colon separated to be more like mopidy-gmusic and so it would interact with existing frontends easier.
- used dephell to generate setup.py from pyproject.toml just so github could parse dependencies.


v0.1.2
========================================

- Minor fixes.
- Updated compatibility with latest versions of ytmusicapi
- Removed ability to list uploads since youtube-dl can't handle them anyway.


v0.1.1
========================================

- Minor fixes.


v0.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
========================================

- Initial release.
